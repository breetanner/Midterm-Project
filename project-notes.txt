Budget Buddy:

What is it?
    - App that allows users to input entire weekly Budget
    - Budget updates when users input purchases

State Representation:
    - total weekly budget (and display)
    - Categories for users to choose from (Entertainment, Food, Clothing, Bills)
    - Set of items that updates total budget accordingly 
    - item information
    - total spent within a given category
    - budget exceeded?

State Change:
    - Enter total budget
    - Total budget number decrease depending on user item input
    - Item is listed within category
    - Update total spent within category
    - Redisplay budget information

Maybe Extra Stuff (If Possible):
    - weekly, monthly, and yearly budget displays
    - remove item option
    - add category button

UX Thoughts (States):
    - enter total budget before seeing anything
    - display budget x/total 

What we Need:
    - items (make item, remove item, update category total)
    - Categories (make cat, update cat)
    - Budget (total budget, remaining budget, update budget)
